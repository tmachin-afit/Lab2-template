# Lab 2
# Python Basics 
This lab goes over Python basics and then some keras basics

## Setup
- Make a new repository using the template from github classroom. You will use this repo to hold the code for the rest of the project.
- Remember to add any large files like `.idea`, `.pyc`, '.hf5' etc. to the `.gitignore` so the large files do not end up on the repo. You should never upload large data files to the git repo. 
- Included for this lab is the `lab2Setup.sh` script and associated `requirements.txt`. Please review these are adjust the packages as necessary. 
<!-- - Remember to change any placeholder code like the `yourname` in the `docker-compose.yml` file to your actual name
- The `docker-compose.yml` file volume mounts some directories that may not exist yet on your computer. If docker makes them it will give them root ownership preventing you from writing to it and causing problems. To prevent this make the folders yourself for example by running `mkdir -p /opt/data/.keras`. If you forget to do this and docker makes the files owned by the root you need to take ownership of the directory with `sudo chmod -R 777 /opt/data/.keras` or change the permissions of the directory with `sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /opt/data/.keras`. Remember the location of the directory on the host computer will be different from the directory when it is mounted in the container.   
- Make a new PyCharm project and configure the `dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` to run your code using the `lab2` service. -->

## Numpy and Matplotlib basics
This section will go over basic array manipulation in numpy. Complete each task in order as they build on each other. You are not allowed to use python loops or list comprehension.
NOTE: when modifying the variable `x` modify it in place like the following code example (unrelated to the lab code):
```python
import numpy as np
x = np.arange(10)
x += 2
x *= 3
```
or equivalently you could just keep assigning back to x
```python 
import numpy as np
x = np.arange(10)
x = x + 2
x = x * 3
```

### Plotting
1. Make an array named `t` which ranges from 0 to 10 in increments of 0.01. (0 should be the first value and the last should be 9.99)
2. Make an array named `x` which is a function of `t` such that  `x=sinc(t)`. Remember that `sinc(0) = 1`. For more infor on the `sinc` function see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinc_function)
3. Plot `x` vs `t` and label all axes. 
4. Using slicing to clip the `x` values to a max of 0.1 and plot again in a new figure. Remember to assign this back to the variable `x`.
5. Multiply the last 100 `x` values by 10 and the second to last 100 values times 2 and plot again on a new figure. Remember again to assign this back to the variable x.
### Tensor Manipulation
Use the modified final value of the array `x` for this section.
1. Slice out values from indices 500 to 509 (not including 509, this array should have 9 values) of `x` and reshape to be 3 by 3 and call that new variable `X`, print this variable `X`
2. Slice out the first 3 values of original array `x` and store that to a variable called `y` and print this new variable `y` 
3. Do a matrix multiplication of `X` and `y` and print the result `z`
4. Next do an elementwise multiplication of `X` and `y` and print the result `Z`
5. Concat horizontally `[X|Z]`(should be a `3 x 6` array) and matrix multiply by `y` concatenated to itself `[y|y]` (should be a 1D array of size 6 or a `6 x 1` 2D array) and print the result `S`.

### Outputs
The output for this section should be three individual plots, and the outputs `X`, `y`, `z`, `Z`, and `S`.

# Keras Basics

## Hello World Mnist
Start a new python script called `hellomnist.py`
Make the network from 3blue1brown to work with the mnist dataset using the instructions below. Use the keras dataset package to load the mnist dataset as shown in the template code.

### 3blue1brown Network:
Note: this is trying to recreate the 3blue1brown network and is not necessarily best practices.
- input should be flattened images of size 784 with grayscale values 0 to 1. 
- output labels should be a vector of size 10 with a one in the index of the correct class
- 2 dense layers with 16 nodes each. For these layers use a sigmoid activation
- 1 Output layer with 10 outputs. For this layer use a linear activation
- compile the model with `mean_squared_error` as a loss and use stochastic gradient descent `sgd` as the optimizer
- keep everything else `keras` defaults
- Train for 30 epochs and validation accuracy should be around 75%. Print this accuracy.

### Your Network
Make your own separate network the beats the 3blue1brown network above. Now you should use some of the best practices from the textbook or `keras` defaults. Use any improvement you want as long as your accuracy is higher. Print this accuracy.

### Dense Data
In order to show that the ANNs in the 3blue1brown (and most likely the one you made) do not think of the data as humans do we will train one last network. 
This network will be exactly the same architecture as the 3blue1brown network, but we will change the training data. We are going to reorder the pixels in every image the **exact same way**. For template function see `hellomnist.py`. Using the template function you can mix up the pixels in your training and test set in the **exact same order** for each image in each dataset. 
Make a plot showing the very first image in the normal dataset and the mixed up dataset. Predict the performance you think the 3blue1brown ANN (trained on the mixed up data) will achieve when trained and evaluated on this dataset (the mixed up data). Write this in a comment in the python script.

Now retrain the 3blue1brown network using the mixed up data and print the accuracy. Next, compare the performance of this new 3blue1brown ANN (trained on the mixed up data) to the first 3blue1brown ANN (trained with the normal data) in a comment in the python script.

## Git
Remember to submit your code to the git repo and post a link on Canvas.

## Easier to Grade
To grade this lab I will clone your repo and then in the project root run the command
```bash
# Run python command
python3 lab2.py
# Run MNIST test
python3 hellomnist.py
```
That should be enough to run the entire lab and show me all the output I have asked for.
